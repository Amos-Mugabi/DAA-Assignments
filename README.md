# DAA-Assignment 2
Example 1. 
Worst Case Scenario:
In the worst case, where the maximum element is at the end of the array or the array is sorted in descending order,
it will require n - 1 comparisons.
time complexity/big o notations: O(n)

Example 2.
Worst Case Scenario:
In the provided code, the worst-case scenario occurs when there are no duplicate elements in the array, 
and it needs to compare each element with every other element in the nested loops.
Time complexity/big o notations:O(n^2)

Example 3. 
Worst Case Scenario:
The worst-case scenario occurs when you have two square matrices A and B, each of size n x n, 
and you need to compute the resulting matrix C by performing n x n multiplications and additions
Time complexity/big o notations: O(n^3).

Example 4. 
Worst Case Scenario:
In the worst case, the code will execute the while loop until 'n' becomes 1.
Time complexity/big o notations: O(logâ‚‚(n))

Example 5
Worst Case Scenario:As 'n' grows larger, the worst-case scenario becomes increasingly challenging, 
and the number of moves grows exponentially
Time complexity/big o notations: O(2^n)
